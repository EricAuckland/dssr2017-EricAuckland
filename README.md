# Introduction
Hello fellow researcher, I hope you have a fortuitous time with this program!
This semi-automatised pre-processing pipeline for NetStation EEG data aims to 1) Pre-process your data in a quick and simple fashion or to 2) Pre-process your data in a more customisable fashion.

# What this does


# Files, programs and toolboxes required
You SHOULD have a number of files from NetStation that you can work with. These are .RAW files which will be re-saved and converted into .set files. 
You WILL need MATLAB, the EEGLAB, ERPLAB and the Statistics and Machine Learning toolboxes.

# How to begin
Make a folder on your system, the desktop is a fine place.
Place your NetStation file/s in this folder.
Copy and paste the EEG_PPPipeline folder into the aforementioned folder.
Double click the EEG_PPPipeline folder and right click and 'run' ????.m
